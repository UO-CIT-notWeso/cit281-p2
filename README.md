# Welcome to my Project 2 page


## Project 2 consisted of:
- Using the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
- Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
- Using git via VSCode
  - Creating and using a .gitignore file
  - Diff split screen

## What I learned:
- Gained experience using git via your CLI and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control
- Gained experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code
- Practiced refactoring JavaScript code
